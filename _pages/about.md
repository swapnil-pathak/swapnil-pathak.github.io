Hello!

My name is Swapnil, I am currently working as a Cyber Security intern at the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. My day job involves penetration testing, static analysis of code and monitoring and remediation of alerts generated by a variety of on-premises tools.

Also, I am a graduate student at the Northeastern university, gradually progressing towards a [Master of Science degree in Cybersecurity](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/program/cybersecurity-ms/).

Moreover, I have earned a Bachelor of Engineering degree in Computer Engineering from University of Pune, India.

I am interested in all things security. My research interests are IoT security and System security. I spend my time doing [HackTheBox](https://www.hackthebox.eu/), Web pentesting, reverse engineering and Leet code.

I have served as a Research Assistant under [Prof. Long Lu](https://www.longlu.org/) at the [Cybersecurity and Privacy Institute](https://cyber.khoury.northeastern.edu/) located in the Interdisciplinary Science and Engineering Complex (ISEC) in Boston, MA. My focus was help design and build a system to automatically find bugs in IoT firmware through [Fuzzing](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Fuzzing).

This blog will contain posts on HackTheBox walkthroughs, Security essentials and my learning experiences and projects. Hopefully, you'll enjoy it and learn something new. For posts on certain topics, feel free to reach out to me. Do keep an eye on the [Recent posts](https://swapnil-pathak.github.io/).
