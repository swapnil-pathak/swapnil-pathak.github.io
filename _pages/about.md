Hello!

I am currently working as a Cybersecurity intern at the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. My day job involves monitoring and remediation of security related alerts generated by a variety of on-premises tools.

Also, I am a graduate student at the Northeastern university, gradually progressing towards a [Master of Science degree in Cybersecurity](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/program/cybersecurity-ms/).

Moreover, I have earned a Bachelor of Engineering degree in Computer Engineering from University of Pune, India.

I am interested in all things security. Specifically, computer systems and IoT. I have served as a Research Assistant under [Prof. Long Lu](https://www.longlu.org/) at the [Cybersecurity and Privacy Institute](https://cyber.khoury.northeastern.edu/) located in the Interdisciplinary Science and Engineering Complex (ISEC) in Boston, MA. My focus was help design and build a system to find bugs in IoT firmware.

I solve a lot of HackTheBox challenges and I will be updating walkthroughs and tricks to solve some of those challenges in my [Security Blog]()

Stay tuned and watch the [Updates]() section.
